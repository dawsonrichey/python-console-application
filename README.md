# Project Description
    -This is a Twilight Zone Themed console application. Beware those who dare enter

# Instructions
    When using PyCharm on a Mac 
        - After you clone this repository you will need to set up the work enviornment
            - You will also need to install python version 3.7 on your local enviornment
            - You also need to install the projects dependencies
                PyCharm -> Preferences -> Project -> project interpreter
    - Despite many missleading file names you will want to run pivot.py to run the console application

# Project Requirements
    Implement a “master loop” console application where the user can repeatedly enter commands/perform actions, including choosing to exit the program
        - pivot.py runs the console application
 
    Implement a log that records errors, invalid inputs, or other important events and writes them to a text file
        - if you choose to take the quiz in the console app you are giving the option to save your results at the end Those results are then recorded in the text log quiz.txt
        
    Create a dictionary or list, populate it with several values, retrieve at least one value, and use it in your program
        - the nerd quiz uses a dictionary to store question and answer value pairs

    
   
    

    
    
    
    
    Read data from an external file, such as text, JSON, CSV, etc and use that data in your application
    Create and call at least 3 functions, at least one of which must return a value that is used
    Implement a regular expression (regex) to ensure a field either a phone number or an email address is always stored and displayed in the same format
    Connect to an external/3rd party API and read data into your app
