Add Project Description
    - This Project will allow the user to select select various treehouse profiles to pull data from. That information will then be used to compare and contrast user data.

I recommend using pycharm as the IDE to run your project. Once you have selected and IDE you will need to make sure the python 3.7 is installed and associated with the project files.
