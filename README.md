# Project Description
    -This is a Twilight Zone Themed console application. Beware those who dare enter

# Instructions
    When using PyCharm on a Mac 
        - After you clone this repository you will need to set up the work enviornment
            - You will also need to install python version 3.7 on your local enviornment
            - You also need to install the projects dependencies
                PyCharm -> Preferences -> Project -> project interpreter
    - Despite many missleading file names you will want to run pivot.py to run the console application

# Project Requirements
    Implement a “master loop” console application where the user can repeatedly enter commands/perform actions, including choosing to exit the program
        - pivot.py runs the console application
 
    Implement a log that records errors, invalid inputs, or other important events and writes them to a text file
        - The users name and menu selections are logged to a the user_log.txt file
        - If you choose to take the quiz in the console app you are giving the option to save your results at the end. Those results are then recorded in the text log quiz.txt
        
    Create a dictionary or list, populate it with several values, retrieve at least one value, and use it in your program
        - The nerd quiz uses a dictionary to store question and answer value pairs
