# Project Description
    -This is a Twilight Zone Themed console application. Beware those who dare enter

# Instructions
    - You will need an IDE to run this project, I recommend PyCharm
    - You will also need to have python version 3.7 installed on your local enviornment
    - Despite many missleading file names you will want to run pivot.py to run the console application

# Project Requirements
    Implement a “master loop” console application where the user can repeatedly enter commands/perform actions, including choosing to exit the program
       - pivot.py is a console application
 
 
# Requirements
    Choose a minimum of 3 of the below features and incorporate into your site
    
    Implement a “master loop” console application where the user can repeatedly enter commands/perform actions, including choosing to exit the program
    
    Create a class, then create at least one object of that class and populate it with data
    
    Create a dictionary or list, populate it with several values, retrieve at least one value, and use it in your program
    Implement a log that records errors, invalid inputs, or other important events and writes them to a text file
    
    Read data from an external file, such as text, JSON, CSV, etc and use that data in your application
    Create and call at least 3 functions, at least one of which must return a value that is used
    Implement a regular expression (regex) to ensure a field either a phone number or an email address is always stored and displayed in the same format
    Connect to an external/3rd party API and read data into your app
    Create 3 or more unit tests for your application
    Build a conversion tool that converts user input to another type and displays it (ex: converts cups to grams)
    Calculate and display data based on an external factor (ex: get the current date, and display how many days remaining until some event)
    Analyze text and display information about it (ex: how many words in a paragraph)
    Visualize data in a graph, chart, or other visual representation of data
    Other features can be added to this list - just ask if your project needs something specific and as long as it’s a good demonstration of your programming skills, it almost certainly will count!  Basically, we just want to see you do something interesting and challenging!
    Additional Requirements
    ALL of the below requirements must be met.
    Your code have comments that document major sections of your code to make it easier to read
    You don’t need to go crazy on this - a few code comments are perfectly fine
    Your project code is uploaded to your GitHub account, in its own repository, with at least 5 commits
    We need to see that you’ve used Git to update your GitHub profile at least 5 times
    Using GitHub’s file uploader does not count as a check-in. You must upload via Git. 
    It must include a README file located at the top level directory of your project that includes:
    A description of your project
    What features you chose to included (so we know what to look for)
    Any special instructions we might need to run your project
